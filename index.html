            <p>The 8th December 2005. St. Margaret’s Hospital in Windsor. A time and date that Melissa will never forget; it was the day she was diagnosed with brain cancer. At 24 years old, she’d never considered it could even be cancer at all when she went for an MRI scan, because “who expects to hear that when you’re 24?”. </p>

            <p>She’d been plagued by horrendous headaches that felt like bolts of lightning for years. But when the sickness, numbness in her body, memory loss and confusion began, it was difficult to pin it down to simply bad migraines. “A&E weren’t investigating my symptoms so we had to try and figure this out ourselves”, she says. Her symptoms were getting worse. Eventually, her nan and grandad could afford to pay for a private MRI scan to get try and get some answers. Melissa remembers that day well. “The doctors at Charing Cross told me that if I’d waited any longer I would have been in a coma by Christmas Day!”. </p>

            <p>Melissa describes the diagnosis of “a mass on my brain” as relief. Finally, she knew these symptoms weren’t just migraines. They were real but she was still unsure of what it all really meant. “Naive, I know! But I’d been led to believe it was a lot more minor than it actually was in the months and weeks leading up to the scan”.  </p>
            <p>“It felt like I was on TV and listening to someone else, not me. My only sadness was my mum and James (Melissa’s then-boyfriend, now husband) sitting behind me.”

            <p>The next day, the doctors performed two emergency surgeries on Melissa’s brain. She had a shunt fitted to relieve the pressure and build up of CNF, caused by the tumour sitting on the 4th ventricle which had been blocking the flow of fluid to the brain. A surgery to reduce the tumour followed a few days later.
               The tumour was Grade 2. It showed few cancerous cells and it was benign.</p>

              </p> Melissa was finally cancer free. </p>

            <p>In the few years after she became free from the disease, Melissa bought her first house with James and the two got engaged on a romantic holiday in New York. She certainly wasn’t expecting a routine scan in October 2008 to be anything different to the usual clear results she’d had before. Not experiencing any symptoms this time compared to the first tumour, it was devastating. </p>
            <p>She doesn’t remember taking anything in about what the doctor said to her that day. It was a huge shock to be told the news that the cancer had not only returned but started growing in other parts of her brain and down her spine. They couldn’t operate this time and she was told she would never be able to have children as a result of the treatments she would need. </p>

            <p>
              Now 27 and determined to be well again, Melissa went into emotional ‘lockdown’ to protect herself and her family. But it became another disappointment to be told radiotherapy was also no longer an option. </p>
            <p>It was at this point that the Huggins family researched alternative treatments and discovered proton therapy. Extremely expensive and only available in Boston, Massachusetts, her doctors were concerned that her family wouldn’t be able to afford the treatment. But Melissa’s parents were determined, saying “we can afford anything to save my daughter’s life.” </p>

            <p>
                This time diagnosed with a Grade 3 Anapalastic Ependymoma, an extremely rare form of tumour, Melissa needed an ‘out of the box’ treatment. Waiting for weeks to find out if the doctors at the Francis Burr Proton therapy centre in Massachusetts General Hospital would accept her, it was a huge relief to discover they could treat her case. Now, she could finally fight this.  </p>

            <p>Her proton therapy treatment began in early 2009. Dr Helen Shih, Associate Medical Director of the Francis Burr Proton Therapy Centre in Boston and one of Melissa’s doctors, describes the difference between normal radiotherapy and proton therapy: </p>

            <p>“Proton radiation is a little bit different to regular radiation. Regular radiation used for radiotherapy can pass through material and this has no charge and no mass. So however much of this is directed towards a patient, some of it will always be absorbed by the person but the rest will pass out the other side.
            </p>

            <p> With proton beams, we actually couple the radiation with proton particles that have both mass and positive charge. It only travels a very small distance so we can control it to make it stay within the cancerous tissue. That way it concentrates on the negatively charged electrons in the specific cells we need to eliminate.
            </p>

            <p> This damages cancer cells only and leaves no radiation in other healthy cells. Too much radiation can have severe side effects (such as lung disease, heart disease or secondary cancers). But the proton therapy beams allow us to use higher amounts of radiation than standard radiotherapy without damaging healthy muscles and regular cells elsewhere in the body, reducing side effects.” </p>

            </blockquote>

            <p>
                This treatment saved Melissa’s life. She was given the all clear in 2009 and now receives regular 6 month check ups to review the results. Her scans now say “no residual change”.
            </p>

            <p>
                Some signs of her treatment remain- her medical tattoos marking the spots the beam needed to be directed towards and slight double vision in her sight. But these only serve as a reminder of the re-markable fight she was determined to win.
                Melissa’s experiences have changed her outlook and she found ways that she could channel her positivity through her treatment:
            </p>

            <p>
              “I found a huge fascination with angels and spiritual books, it gave me such comfort. I literally had to train my mind to think in a healthy way and visualise my body without cancer. I strongly think that you can make things happen if you truly believe. I’m not perfect and I knew it wasn’t going to be easy but I didn’t have a choice. I now have such great respect for every single being who helped me and touched my life in both happy and dark days back then.”

           </p>Today, Melissa is healthy and happy. Still married to James, they welcomed the incredible news that Melissa was pregnant in 2015, a prospect they believed would never exist. Their daughter Avé is now a “feisty two year old” and keeps her mother very busy. Melissa continues to enjoy life every day and hopes to work for a charity to help others. She’s eternally grateful to proton therapy and her doctors for saving her life. </p>
